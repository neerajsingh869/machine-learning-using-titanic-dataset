# machine-learning-using-titanic-dataset
Here, I have implemented all the steps of Machine learning thoroughly using titanic Dataset.
## Step 1 - Defining the Problem
## Step 2 - Building Dataset
            2.1 Dataset Collection
            2.2 Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering and Feature Selection
                        2.2.1 - Data Understanding
                        2.2.2 - Data Cleaning and Data Manipulation
                        2.2.3 - Relationship Analysis
## Step 3 - Model Building and Training
## Step 4 - Model Evaluation
